# Transactive Energy in Microgrid Solar Network using Blockchain Technologies

## Introduction

We are investigating the possibilities of enabling a transactive energy scenario on a small scale microgrid solar network leveraging blockchain technologies, specifically Ethereum platform and smart contract. In this work, we propose a system model where nodes can share energy surplus among each other and use smart contracts to execute the transactions. We built a working prototype to demonstrate the model.

## Background

**Transactive energy** (TE) is a two-way grid management approach that ensures the proper functioning of power networks with large amounts of distributed energy resource (DER) and allows DER owners to earn a commensurate return on their investments.

A Microgrid is a localized group of electricity sources and loads that operate connected to and synchronous with the traditional centralized grid but can disconnect and maintain operation autonomously as physical and/or economic conditions dictate.

The Blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value. Ethereum is built on blockchain technologies that run smart contracts, which are applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.
